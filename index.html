              The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San Francisco,
              California. The band consists a dynamic lineup featuring two lead
              vocalists, two guitarists, a bassist, a keyboardist and a drummer.
              The band achieved its first commercial success as an unsigned act,
              drawing attention from their future manager. Having extensive
              experience working with both new and seasoned acts, the manager
              was confident the band could succeed even further with more
              support, pushing The Bees Knees to sign with a well known record
              label.
            </p>
            <p>
              From there, the band has soared, gaining international recognition
              and ranking in the top 10 on the Poster Charts. New fans
              immediately fell in love with the band’s original and organic
              attitude, solidifying their place as one of the hottest and
              fastest up and coming acts of this century. Fans affectionately
              refer to themselves as “The Hive” and are drawn to their candid
              and authentic performances on stage. The Bees Knees are currently
              recording their second studio album, looking to be released in
              early 2024.
